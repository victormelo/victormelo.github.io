 text: I am a Software Developer based on Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil.
  I am proficient on several programming languages and web development frameworks (mostly self-taught).
  I am also a Machine Learning and Computer Vision master degree student, working specifically on the application of Deep Learning approaches to Handwritten Signature Verification.

skills-disclaimer: Skills with <= 3 stars suggest that I am not that experienced or need some research
  before the get going. However, if you give me a week or a weekend I can do pretty much whatever is "technically" possible.
